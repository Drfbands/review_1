			<h2 class="adcopy">Money is the most desired - But Health is the most enjoyed; </h2>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Everybody wants to get into shape, but few people know how to stay motivated long enough to do so.
				<br>
				<br>
		And I can really empathize, because from Infomercials to various YouTube videos, and endless classes at gyms, there are just too many resources that leave you wondering “Where is all this exercise stuff going?”
		<br>
		<br>
		The hardest part about getting into shape is having the motivation to stick with it; as well as finding the time to work out. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Over the years of being a personal trainer; I found that the individuals who are successful at reaching their fitness goals are the ones who can stay commited.
		<br>
		<br>
		And I believe that their is a right way and a wrong way to go about staying committed to a fitness program. <br>
		<br>
		 And much of that comes down to how you set your goals "BEfore" you even start working out.  
		<br>
		<br>
		A goal of "I want to lose 20 lbs" (or any concrete number), or things like "I just to get more toned" are setting you up for failure "Before" you even start. 
		<br> 
		<br>
		And the reason is that with losing weight (or any fitness goal) it's a 2 step forward; 1 step back process. 
		<br>
		<br>
		 This can get frustrating and discourging at first. 
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 And what happens is that all the inspiration, exicitement, and nervousness you have before you start. And your mindset is "I get to transform myself into a better version of me" quickly slides into "I got to exercise today; I'm so far away from where I want to be."
		 <br>
		 <br> 
		 Their is a big difference between "I get to" and "I got to". Once the excitement of "I get to" turns into "I got to" defeat is right around the corner.
		 <br> 
		 <br>
		 But here's why you are going to achieve your New Years resolution this year. Because were going to get started off right this 2015 New Year. Even before your first workout. We're going to set the correct goals and have you in success mindsey that will allow you to reach your health and fitness goals to make you the best version of you possible. 
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 What I ask from you is that all you worry about is getting to, and through the next workout. Commiting tp one week at a time. And leave the results to me. Together, you will achieve your fitness goals that you have in your mind right now; and much more!
		 <br>
		 <br> 
		 So call today, and let's begin this journey of reaching your New Years Weight Loss goals.
